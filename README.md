# Interactive Rating Component

This project is an **Interactive Rating Component** built as part of a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). The component allows users to rate a service by selecting a score from 1 to 5. After submitting their rating, users are shown a thank-you message with their selected score. The design is interactive, responsive, and visually appealing, with hover effects and smooth transitions.

## Features

- **Interactive Rating System**: Users can select a rating from 1 to 5 by clicking on the corresponding button.
- **Thank-You Message**: After submitting the rating, users are shown a thank-you message with their selected score.
- **Responsive Design**: The component is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive hover effects on the rating buttons and submit button for better user experience.
- **Modern Typography**: Utilizes the "Overpass" font from Google Fonts for clean and modern typography.
